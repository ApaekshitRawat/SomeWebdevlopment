<p>A gymnasium, also known as a gym, is a covered location for athletics.<br>
The word is derived from the ancient Greek gymnasium.[1] They are commonly<br>
 found in athletic and fitness centers, and as activity and learning spaces<br>
in educational institutions. "Gym" is also slang for "fitness center", which<br> 
is often an area for indoor recreation. A gym may be open air as well. A gym<br> 
is a place with number of equipments and machines used by the people to do exercises.</p>
